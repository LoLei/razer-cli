        Setting breath_dual to:
           [ 75 234 74 ]
           [ 249 153 44 ]

In this example the effect 'multicolor' (1st effect) is applied to the 'generic' zone 
Multicolor was given [99, 4, 155] and [192, 108, 166] for RGB colors, multicolpr defaults to random colors 
   Refer to the effect manual entry for details 
Then the 'spectrum' (2ed) effect is applied to the logo and scroll zone as 'logo,scroll' is the 2ed zone 
Then brightness is set to 50% for the logo and wheel zones 
Then the 'breath_dual' effect (4th) is applied to the 4th zone logo 
Breath_dual was given the colors [ 75 234 74 ] and [ 249 153 44 ] as we made use of the colors the mouse already set to use for the logo zone 
   Refer to the color manual entry for details 
You will notice that scroll and wheel are not real zones, but typing scroll_wheel is tedious so you can use them as aliases for scroll_wheel 
   Refer to the zone manual entry for details
