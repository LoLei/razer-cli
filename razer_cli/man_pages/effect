Effect arguments can any of the following:
    breath_dual, breath_random, breath_single, breath_triple, none, reactive, ripple, ripple_random, spectrum, starlight_dual, starlight_random, starlight_single, static, wave, and multicolor 
Each effect is applied to 1 zone, remember that 'logo,right' is 1 zone and 'left right' is 2 zones
The following effects support a second argument by adding a comma followed by a number:
    active, brightness, reactive, starlight_single, starlight_dual, starlight_random, wave, and multicolor
    active,[0-1]
        0 sets active to False
        1 sets active to True
        Defaults to True
    brightness,[0-100]
        % brightness (this is the PWM Duty Cycle)
        If not specified it will be 100
        This is the same things as --brightness
        Example usage:
            razer-cli -e static brightness,75 -z logo logo -c FF0000
    ripple,[0-∞] & ripple_random,[0-∞]
        Defaults to 0.05 as defined in openrazer: https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/blob/master/pylib/openrazer/client/constants.py
        This is the fresh rate of the effect
    reactive,[1-4]
        1 = 500ms, 2 = 1000ms, 3 = 1500ms, and 4 = 2000ms
        If not specified it will be chosen at random
    starlight_single,[1-3], starlight_dual,[1-3], and starlight_random,[1-3]
        1 = fast, 2 = normal, and 3 = slow
        If not specified it will be chosen at random
    wave,[1-2]
        1 = right and 2 = left
        If not specified it will be chosen at random
    multicolor,[0-∞]
        0 = assign random colors for everything (does not consume colors)
        1-∞ = the number of colors to use from -c
        This defaults to 0
    The following effects do NOT consume colors:
        none, active, brightness, breath_random, spectrum, starlight_random, and wave If you only specify 1 effect it will be applied all zone
