Color arguments can be and of the following (not case sensitive):
    Hex Codes (eg: FF00FF)
    RGB (eg: 255 0 255)
    RNG (eg: RANDOM)
    X   (eg: x)
    X will use the Xcolor setting on from your desktop environment,
       it will use a random color if none is found
    You can mix these as you please eg:
        --color RANDOM 255 0 255 FF00FF
    If no color is given try the following:
       1. Colors will be read from the device
          * Assuming your version openrazer has this feature
       2. The system X color will be used
          * Assuming you have one set
       3. A random color will be made
